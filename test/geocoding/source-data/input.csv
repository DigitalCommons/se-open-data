<p>Co-op is engaged in varieties of businesses and any of those is a need-driven one. The main objective is to improve the welfare of its members. Therefore they perform social and cultural activities going far beyond their economic operations.</p>

<p>Governance Consumers&#39; cooperatives utilize the cooperative principle of democratic member control, or one member/one vote. Most consumers&#39; cooperatives have a board of directors elected by and from the membership. The board is usually responsible for hiring management and ensuring that the cooperative meets its goals, both fiscal and otherwise. Democratic functions, such as petitioning or recall of board members, may be codified in the bylaws or organizing document of the cooperative. Most consumers&#39; cooperatives hold regular membership meetings (often once a year). HistoryThe history of Japanese Consumers&#39; Co-operative dates back in the 1919. Japanese Co-operative Society was initiated during the era of Taisho democracy. In 1919, the &quot;Katei Kobai (purchasing) union&quot; was established in Tokyo. During the following year, 1920, the &quot;Kyoueki-sha Kobai union&quot; was established, in Osaka, and in 1921 the &quot;Limited responsibility Kobe Kobai union&quot; was also established in Kobe. This gives the starting history of the regional purchasing co-op. By entering the Showa period (1926), the strengthened economic control and the staffs&#39; compulsory military drafts by war almost suffocated co-op. After the end of the war in 1945, in the severe food shortage and exceptional inflation, co-ops were established once again across the country. In 1947, about three million people became members nationwide. In 1948, the law for consumers&#39; cooperative union was enacted and in 1951, Japan Consumers&#39; Cooperative Union was established. During 1950s, co-ops for regional labors and institutional co-ops were established across the country. During the years of steep economic growth in 1960s, the consumers&#39; movement against price inflations and harmful food additives was promoted. Co-op led the movement. Between the end of 1960s and 1970s, community residents as its members organized citizen&#39;s co-ops. These citizen&#39;s co-ops built up the non-store business such as joint purchasing and individual deliveries. Japanese co-ops are in a new developing period now. Today, Co-ops are an integral part of communities with 37% of all households in Japan belonging to a Co-op.( Source: &nbsp;&quot;History&quot; , Japanese Consumers&#39; Co-operative Union ( JCCU) website, Date of Access: May 23th 2016,</p>

<p>JOR was formed in 1997 to replace a bankrupt quasi-government co-operative society that was formed just after the 1967 war. In 1998 Jordan brought in the World Bank, with assistance from the ILO, to do an updating of its cooperative sector.  As a part of this process JOR was limited to registration and management of cooperative law; coop sector coordination shifted to another organisation. At that time, Jordan also updated its coop laws and developed a new overall coop strategy.</p>

2004,The Kibbutz Movement,"<p>The Kibbutz is a rural settlement whose residents are members of a multi purpose cooperative. The cooperative (= the Kibbutz) owns its houses, factories, land etc. It provides the members work, education, health, housing, culture,community services, old age care &ndash; all of life&#39;s aspects. The original Kibbutz was more of a commune, people gave what they could (working) and received what they needed. About 15-20 years ago, following a big econoomical crisis, about 200 Kibbutzim made a change &ndash; members there earn differently according to their skills and abilities, they all pay a tax that provides the community services, including education, culture and old age care.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a mechanism of mutual care, if a member loses his ability to work, the community will provide. These Kibbutzim are now more cooperatives than communes. They have mutual assets (factories, agriculture, tourism facilities) which they own together and run democratically.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The whole life&nbsp;is being managed by many comeeties, in which members participate.</p>

<p>All managers are being elected by the assembly for terms of 3-5 years.</p>

<p>Since the change, there are many variants of Kibbutzim.</p>

<p>The Kibbutz Movement is a secondary cooperative of all Kibbutzim. It represents them,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; accompanies, stores knowledge. The general secretary of the Kibbutz Mocement is elected by all Kibbutz&#39; members.</p>

3096,The Co-operative Alliance of Kenya (CAK),"<p>The Cooperative Alliance of Kenya (CAK) is the National Apex Organization for Kenya&#39;s Co-operative Movement. Following the completion of the new National Co-operative Development, CAK is undergoing re-structuring to align itself to the proposed four tier structure. In essence the membership of CAK going forward would be restricted to the national federations hitherto referred to as national co-operative organizations and associate members. Consequently, the CAK By-Laws are also being reviewed to align with the new provisions. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The sub-sector specific Federations will draw their membership from co-operative unions whose membership constituted by of over 24,950 Co-operative societies registered in Kenya. Membership of co-operative societies in Kenya is dominated by Savings and Credit societies, referred as to as SACCOs.</p>

<p>CAK was registered on 22nd December 2009 under the Co-operative Societies Act, CAP 490 of 2004, to replace the hitherto National Apex body, Kenya National Federation of Co-operatives (KNFC). The Kenya National Federation of Co-operatives (KNFC) formed in 1964, as the first Apex organization, had the key objective of promoting the development of the Co-operative Movement in Kenya. &nbsp;It was a member of the ICA from 1966 to 1993 when organisation was dissolved.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The formation of CAK was a response to the need by the Co-operative Movement to have a single voice in addressing its concerns on the national and international stage. CAK&#39;s primary role is that of lobby and advocacy for a favourable legal and policy environment. Also it has the role of collaboration, networking, representation, and the promotion of the growth and development of the Co-operative Movement.</p>

<p>CAK&#39;s vision is, &lsquo;Every Kenyan is a co-operator&rsquo; which resonates with the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development of &lsquo;Leave No One Behind.&rsquo; &nbsp;Its mission is to articulate and promote the interests of the Co-operative movement locally and internationally for wealth creation and social development.</p>

<p>CAK currently has 8 federation members.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The coop movement in Kenya has 24,950 cooperative unions with over 15 million members with mobilized savings of over US$ 6.40 billion or 35% of the National Savings. Those employed in the sector are over 600,000 persons.</p>

3210,Cooperative Bank of Oromia,"<p>Ethiopia has a very low financial service coverage as mainstream financial institutions are heavily tilted towards the urban centers having good physical infrastructure, leaving the rural areas underserved. Traditionally, &lsquo;Equbs&rsquo; and &lsquo;Idirs&rsquo; are informal institutions that are deeply ingrained in the life communities and have also been serving financial needs of the society. Reluctance and low capacity of the financial institutions in the country to serve rural community, a demand-supply gap prevailed in financial market especially in rural areas, coupled with farmers awareness to be organized in to cooperatives and the increasing need to finance cooperatives&rsquo; called for establishment of a cooperative bank. Furthermore, finance appeared to be the critical bottleneck to sustain the cooperative institutions and ultimately the farmers. It was all these glitches that initiated the inception and establishment of Cooperative Bank of Oromia.</p>

<p>Mr. Haile Gebre Lube, regarded as the founding father (proponent) of Ethiopia&rsquo;s cooperatives, brought the idea of founding the bank for he believed that the best way to fight poverty is through cooperation. Formally establishing a project once in 2002, the bank&rsquo;s formation was realized with majority of shareholders being the cooperative societies. The bank then is commercially licensed in October 2004 and commenced operations in March 2005. As there is no legal provisions that allow establishment of a cooperative bank in the country, the bank was registered in accordance with article 304 of the commercial code of Ethiopia although about 73% of its share was owned by cooperatives at the time of establishment.</p>

<p>Currently, 65% of the share of the bank is owned by primary cooperatives, cooperative unions and cooperative federations. Their shareholder membership is also comprised of organisations, associations and individuals, all who have voting rights at their General Assembly. They also have development projects for cooperatives.</p>

1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A legal role/function covering the registration, financial and administrative audit of cooperatives, and other regulatory procedures such as liquidation of coops and investigation into coop financial/administrative issues. This role is currently active.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Promoting and supporting the development of coops through education/awareness raising (to be institutionalied through the Cooperative Development Institute) as well as facilitating coop access to funding and capacity building in the area of business planning (to be institutionalised through the Cooeprative Development Fund). These will take some time to fully operationalize.&nbsp;<br />
The strategic objectives of CWA as spelled out in the 2017-22 Strategy are as follows:<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Build an institutional environment that enables the cooperative movement to grow and develop.<br />
