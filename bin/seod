usage = <<USAGE
usage:
   #{File.basename(__FILE__)} <command>

Where <command> can be:

- download
- convert
- generate
- deploy
- create_w3id
- triplestore
- run_all
- clean

The return code indicates whether these commands succeed or not. A
zero return code indicuates success, as usual for console commands. A
non-zero value indicates something else: typically failure.

However the download command may return the value 100 to indicate that
either there is no download script, or that it has determined there is
no new data to download. This is so that later steps can be skipped in
this case.
